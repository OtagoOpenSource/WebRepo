Our choice of programming language should relate to existing skill with the language(s) in question. There are no
significant technical advantages in either proposed language (PHP, Python) with regards to our scale, project etc.

Both languages support output to pdf via extension.

We should investigate existing frameworks, though a simple custom CMS wouldn't take too much to implement.

Any thoughts?
