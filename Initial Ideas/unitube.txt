This is an email Brendan received about getting involved in Unitube, the University's streaming media server

>
> Hi Brendan,
>
> This sounds really interesting! An open source HEDC project that would
> be great to get students involved in is unitube:
>
> http://unitube.otago.ac.nz 
>
> It was released under a GPL 3.0 licence (with the full permission of the
> University via the then DVC A & I, Gareth Jones) a couple of years ago
> and the source is available here:
>
> https://github.com/edmedia/unitube
>
> (Richard will be updating github in the next few days with the latest
> version)
>
> Essentially unitube is a media sharing service but tailored specifically
> for higher education. Staff and students use it to share audio, video,
> pdfs, slides etc..
>
> Two additional features: 
>
> 1. Image viewer - an online microscope-like application for viewing,
> measuring and annotating images.
>
> 2. A presenter tool for synchronising slides or text documents with
> audio/video files. (A bit like slideshare)
>
> We're currently in the final throes of setting up an institutionally
> managed version with ITS. When this is up and running - hopefully within
> the next couple of months - we'll be promoting unitube much more widely.
> Currently several hundred staff and a few otago thousand students use
> unitube for teaching/learning related work. 
>
> HEDC will continue to manage ongoing development and research for the
> project and lots of opportunities for additions, ideas etc.
>
> Outside of Otago, unitube is also in use by the Raukawa wananga in Otaki
> with a version customised for them by Catalyst IT in Wellington.
>
> Happy to chat if you need anything further. I've cc'd our developers
> Richard Zeng (lead) and Adon Moskal as well - please feel free to
> contact Richard directly especially for detailed technical information.
>
> Cheers,
> Jenny
