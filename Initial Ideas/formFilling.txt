Large organisations like the University produce large numbers of forms and 
documents that need to be completed and correctly formatted. As a small 
example, academic staff must maintain CVs in a specific format. Much of the 
information in the CV (publications, postgraduate supervision, teaching 
responsibilites, etc.) is duplicated elsewhere in the system.

There are many issues with a system such as this. Firstly, the forms are in a 
variety of formats and often difficult to work with. Some are word documents, 
some are PDFs, and many of the PDFs are not form-fillable. Secondly, the 
duplication of information leads to data inconsistency and - whenever I publish 
a paper I should notify the publications office (on a paper form), update my CV 
(a word doc that I maintain), and update various websites (my personal research 
pages, the department's research pages, the lab's research pages). These 
rapidly get out of synch. Finally, it is often unclear to staff what forms they 
should be using and how information should be presented.

A possible solution to this would be a centralised repository of information 
that could be used to automatically generate the required outputs. Information 
could be done via online forms, and data could be verified and authenticated 
when necessary.
